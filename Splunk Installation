In this section, I will provide an overview of the steps to take in order for you to install Splunk and create your very own Splunk Environment. I will aslo be providing an explanation to their functions to understand how they tie in together

NOTE: NEVER RUN Splunk AS THE ROOT USER.
	1. Create a splunk user with chown and sudo permissions.
		a. Create the splunk group
			i. Sudo addgroup splunk
		b. Create the Splunk user:
			i. sudo adduser splunk
		c. Add the Splunk user to the splunk group
			i. sudo usermod -aG splunk splunk
		d. Provide the Splunk user with sudo permissions
			i. Sudo usermod -aG sudo splunk
		e. Verify that the splunk user has been added to the splunk group
			i. groups splunk
	2. Navigate to the installation directory.
		a. cd /opt 
			i. Install the splunk directory with tar -xvf <splunk tgz file>
		b. Assign the ownership of the splunk directory to the splunk user.
			i. sudo chown -R splunk:splunk /opt/splunk
	3. Start the Splunk Instance
		a. ./splunk start --accept-license --answer-yes
		b. Create a username 
		c. Create a password
	4. Enable boot-start for splunk (Personal Preference)
		a. sudo ./splunk enable boot-start -user splunk
		b. Verify that the splunk service is inside of the init.d directory. 
			i. ls /etc/init.d/splunk

You should be able to access your splunk instance in your local host environment on http://localhost:8000/. 

If you are using a cloud environment such as AWS, GCP, or AZURE, use the external IP:8000 to access your splunk web.
